Insectivorous bats are strictly nocturnal animals that are vulnerable to disruption from artificial light. Given that many light-sensitive bats tend to avoid night light during roost departure, it is often assumed that nighttime light pollution reduces their foraging opportunities, albeit empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis remains elusive. Here, we used least horseshoe bats, Rhinolophus pusillus, to assess whether white artificial light is detrimental for the opportunities of foraging. We manipulated the levels of ambient illumination and perceived predation risk inside the bat roost. We monitored bats' emergence activity using high-speed video and audio recording systems. DNA based faecal dietary analysis and insect survey were applied to determine activity time of prey in foraging areas. Following experimentally manipulation of white light-emitting diode (LED) lighting 0-15 min after sunset, bat pass, flight duration, and echolocation pulse emission decreased. The mean emergence time of bats flying out was delayed by 14 min under lit treatment compared with the dark control. Only 10% of bats left for foraging during 40 min of light exposure. Aversive effects of LED light on bat emergence were robust regardless of the presence of a potential predator. Insect prey reached a peak of abundance between 30 and 60 min after sunset. These results demonstrate that white artificial light hinders evening emergence behavior in least horseshoe bats, leading to a mismatch between foraging onset and peak food availability. Our findings highlight that light pollution overrides foraging onset, suggesting the importance of improving artificial lighting scheme near the roosts of light-sensitive bats.",01/11/2021,03/03/2025 21:00,03/03/2025 21:00,,,288

However, the impacts of artificial light on foraging behavior in most wild animals remain largely unclear. Here, we aimed to assess whether artificial light affects foraging behavior in Asian parti-colored bats (Vespertilio sinensis). We manipulated the spectra of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting in a laboratory. Using video and audio recording, we monitored foraging onset, total foraging time, food consumption, freezing behavior (temporary cessation of body movement), and echolocation vocalizations in triads of bats under each lighting condition. Analyses showed that the foraging activities of experimental bats were reduced under LED light. Green, yellow, and red light had greater negative effects on bats' foraging onset, total foraging time, and food consumption than white and blue light. LED light of different spectra induced increased freezing time and echolocation vocalizations in captive bats, except for the white light. The peak wavelength of light emission correlated positively with freezing time, estimated echolocation pulse rate (the number of echolocation pulses per minute), and foraging onset, but negatively with total foraging time and food consumption. These results demonstrate that artificial light disturbs foraging behavior in Asian parti-colored bats. Our findings have implications for understanding the influencing mechanism of light pollution on bat foraging. We used Asian parti-colored bats as a model to explore the impacts of artificial light on foraging behavior. We found that bats reduced their foraging activity under white, blue, green, yellow, and red light. The peak wavelength of light was tightly linked to foraging activity, freezing time, and echolocation vocalizations of bats. This study expands our knowledge of the behavioral responses of bats to artificial light with different spectral compositions. image",2024-07,03/03/2025 21:00,03/03/2025 21:00,710-720,4,19

Understanding the implications of this disturbance for species and populations is crucial for conservation biologists wishing to mitigate negative effects. Anthropogenic light pollution is an increasing global problem [2], affecting ecological interactions across a range of taxa and impacting negatively upon critical animal behaviors including foraging, reproduction, and communication (for review see [2, 3]). Almost all bats are nocturnal [4], making them ideal subjects for testing the effects of light pollution. Previous studies have shown that bat species adapted to foraging in open environments feed on insects attracted to mercury vapor lamps. Here, we use an experimental approach to provide the first evidence of a negative effect of artificial light pollution on the commuting behavior of a threatened bat species. We installed high-pressure sodium lights that mimic the intensity and light spectra of streetlights along commuting routes of lesser horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus hipposideros). Bat activity was reduced dramatically and the onset of commuting behavior was delayed in the presence of lighting, with no evidence of habituation. These results demonstrate that light pollution may have significant negative impacts upon the selection of flight routes by bats.",14/07/2009,03/03/2025 21:00,03/03/2025 21:00,1123-1127,13,19
